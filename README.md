## Introduction 
This README file contains instructions of how to properly setup and navigate the functions of the Crystalry project. 
Administrators will have access to the site for them to test out, alongside the build which will enable them to
check how it is made.
	
## Setup 
Project is made using an HTML editor. Recommended HTML editors to access the HTML file are [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) and 
[Atom](https://atom.io/).

The CI and test automation frameworks for these respectively are:
* **Buddy CI**, since it runs in parallel 
* **testproject.io**, since it is open source and runs automated tests quickly.

In order to connect the GitHub repository to Buddy CI, obtain the webhook from GitHub and type this:

$ git push Crystalry 



## Testing 
* To test the project, open the HTML file to access the website.
* Navigate through the website by clicking on the tabs to access the different pages.
